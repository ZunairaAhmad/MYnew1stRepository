    <h1> Welcome To Git Website</h1>
    <h2> Git init: </h2>
    <h3> The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to 
     a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository. Most other Git commands are not available outside of an initialized repository,
      so this is usually the first command you will run in a new project.</h3>

    <h2> Git status: </h2>
    <h3> The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged,
         which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. Status output does not show you any information regarding the committed 
         project history.</h3>

    <h2> Git add: </h2>
    <h3> The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular
         file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant way—changes are not actually recorded until
        you run git commit .</h3>

        <h2> Git commit: </h2>
        <h3> The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as
             “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to. Enter git commit -m '<commit_message>' 
            at the command line to commit new files/changes to the local repository. For the <commit_message>, you can enter anything that
             describes the changes you are committing.</h3>
        <h2> Git push: </h2>
        <h3>The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your
         local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports
        commits to remote branches. </h3>

      <h2> Git remote add origin: </h2>
      <h3>TObtain the git remote add URL for the remote repository and add credentials if needed. Run the git remote add origin command from your local
         repository with the --set-upstream and the name of the active branch to push. </h3>
         <img src="./Pics/gitremote.png" >
       <h2> Git pull: </h2>
      <h3> The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that
          content. Merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a common task in Git-based collaboration work flows. </h3>
